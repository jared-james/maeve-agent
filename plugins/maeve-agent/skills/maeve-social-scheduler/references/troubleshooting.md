## Auth Failures

Run:

```bash
maeve auth:status
maeve auth:whoami
```

Credential precedence is:

1. `--api-key`
2. `--api-key-env <name>`
3. `MAEVE_API_KEY`
4. Stored CLI login token

For automation, prefer env vars. For local sessions, use:

```bash
maeve auth:login
```

Browser login tokens expire after 7 days and are stored per API URL.

For workspace-scoped keys stored under a named environment variable, do not paste the key value into commands or chat. Pass the variable name:

```bash
maeve --api-key-env MAEVE_API_KEY_LILY_DIA_JEWELLERY_DEMO_KEY auth:status
maeve --api-key-env MAEVE_API_KEY_LILY_DIA_JEWELLERY_DEMO_KEY media:labels:list --workspace <workspaceId>
```

When `--api-key-env` is provided, that named variable must exist. The CLI will not silently fall back to `MAEVE_API_KEY`.

For hosted MCP, first use the MCP client's **Authenticate** action. It should open Maeve in the browser, ask the user to approve access, and return to the MCP client. Browser-authenticated MCP has been validated with Codex and Claude Code.

MCP access tokens last 6 hours and refresh through 90-day rotating refresh tokens. If an MCP client cannot refresh, was revoked, or asks for approval again, choose **Authenticate** again. Organization admins can revoke active AI tool connections in Maeve **Settings -> Developer**.

If browser auth is not supported by the MCP client, use the API-key fallback. Set `MAEVE_API_KEY` in the shell or client secret storage. Do not put the key in `.mcp.json`, `config.toml`, command history, screenshots, or chat.

CLI login is separate. `maeve auth:login` signs in the CLI only; it does not create an MCP token.

If `maeve --help` shows `media:tags:*` instead of `media:labels:*`, the globally installed CLI is stale. Upgrade with `npm install -g maeve-cli@latest`, or run commands through `npx maeve-cli@latest` until the global install is refreshed.

## Missing Workspace

Run:

```bash
maeve workspaces:list
```

If a workspace is missing, the current credential likely does not belong to the expected organization or lacks access.

## Missing Or Unusable Integration

Run:

```bash
maeve integrations:list --workspace <workspaceId>
maeve integrations:capabilities --workspace <workspaceId> --integration <integrationId>
```

Status meanings:

- `connected`: safe to use.
- `requires_reauth`: ask the user to reconnect the social account.
- `disabled`: ask the user to enable or choose another integration.
- `auth_incomplete`: ask the user to finish provider authorization.

If capabilities says an option key is unsupported, refetch capabilities for the exact integration ID; option keys are platform-specific.

## JSON Validation Errors

Common fixes:

- Ensure payload files are valid JSON, not JavaScript.
- Ensure IDs are UUID strings; grid planner IDs must be UUIDv4.
- Include at least one field for update payloads.
- For create content, include `integrationId` and at least one useful draft field such as `captions.canonical`, `internalTitle`, `publishTitle`, or `contentMedia`.
- Keep `captions.canonical` and caption overrides at or below 25000 characters.
- Use `contentMedia` for content attachments. Keep it to 10 or fewer items before applying stricter platform `maxMedia` from capabilities.
- For approval/client-review comments, include `body` or `attachmentId`.
- For inbox replies, include `content` or `attachment`.
- For grid create, include `mediaIds` for `visual_only` or `linkedContentId` for `linked_post`.
- For analytics reports, include `integrationId` or unique `integrationIds`.

## Timezone Errors

`scheduledAt` must be ISO 8601 with an explicit timezone:

```json
{ "scheduledAt": "2026-05-01T10:00:00+10:00" }
```

Valid examples include offsets like `+10:00` and UTC `Z`. Do not use vague dates such as "tomorrow morning" in payloads.

## Platform Requirement Errors

Run capabilities before retrying:

```bash
maeve integrations:capabilities --workspace <workspaceId> --integration <integrationId>
```

Then check:

- `requiresMedia`: upload/select media first.
- `requiresTitle`: include `publishTitle`.
- `maxMedia`: reduce attached media.
- `postTypes`: choose a supported `postType`.
- `mediaTypes`: choose supported uploaded media.
- `settings.fields`: move platform-specific values into `settings` using supported keys.
- `optionKey`: fetch dynamic options before choosing values.

Known strict cases:

- Pinterest requires media, `publishTitle`, and `settings.boardId`.
- YouTube requires one video and `publishTitle`.
- TikTok requires media, `publishTitle`, and account-specific privacy options.
- Instagram requires media.

## Plan Or Role Errors

Approval history, client reviews, approval decisions/comments, pending approval counts, boosts, and analytics PDF reports require a standard workspace plan and specific roles.

If the command says it requires a plan or the role is denied, report the plan/role blocker and do not retry with different payloads unless the user changes workspace/account.

## Rate Limits And Provider Errors

If a command fails with rate limit or provider errors:

- Do not immediately loop retries.
- Preserve the command, workspace, integration, content/media/message ID, provider/platform, and error code/message in the response.
- For provider auth errors, recheck integration status.
- For transient provider errors, ask whether to retry later or use `content:retry`/`inbox:retry-message` only after confirmation.

## Output And Debugging

Successful commands write JSON to stdout. Errors write structured JSON to stderr and exit non-zero.

For list commands, use filters to reduce noise:

```bash
maeve content:list --workspace <workspaceId> --status scheduled
maeve inbox:threads --workspace <workspaceId> --read unread
maeve media:list --workspace <workspaceId> --type image --favorite
```
