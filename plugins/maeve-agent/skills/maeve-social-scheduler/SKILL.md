description: Operate Maeve social scheduling, publishing, content management, media library, approvals, analytics, inbox, grid planner, hashtags, taxonomy, and Maeve CLI/API automation. Use when an agent needs to discover Maeve workspaces or integrations, create drafts, schedule posts, publish content, manage media, inspect analytics, handle approvals or client reviews, process inbox work, or automate social operations safely through Maeve.

# Maeve Social Scheduler

Use this skill to operate Maeve safely through the repo-supported automation surface.

## Operating Order

1. If the hosted Maeve MCP server is already connected in the current agent environment, start supported reads with MCP tools such as `list_workspaces` instead of opening the CLI path first.
2. Run `maeve auth:status` before CLI or direct API fallback work.
3. Prefer the Maeve CLI when MCP is not connected, when the workflow is not covered by MCP, or when local files/full CLI behavior are needed.
4. Use direct public API calls only when MCP and the CLI cannot perform the task.
5. Prefer the MCP client's browser authentication when MCP is available. Use environment credentials such as `MAEVE_API_KEY` for CLI/API automation or MCP fallback. Never ask users to paste API keys, login tokens, OAuth codes, presigned URLs, or raw provider payloads into chat.

## Discovery Workflow

Before creating, scheduling, publishing, or updating content:

1. Identify the workspace with `maeve workspaces:list` or the user-provided workspace ID.
2. Identify the integration with `maeve integrations:list --workspace <id>`.
3. Inspect platform requirements with `maeve integrations:capabilities --workspace <id> --integration <id>`.
4. If a capability field includes a dynamic option key, fetch options with MCP `get_integration_options` when connected, or `maeve integrations:options` as the CLI fallback.
5. Inspect existing media, taxonomy, hashtags, content, analytics, inbox, or grid planner state as needed for the requested workflow.

## Mutation Defaults

- Create drafts by default. For content creation, omit `intent` or set `intent: "draft"` unless the user explicitly asked to schedule or publish.
- When MCP is connected, use `create_draft_content` for supported draft creation after workspace, integration, capabilities, and needed options are resolved; use CLI `content:create` as the fallback.
- Do not schedule unless the user provides an explicit date, time, and timezone.
- Do not publish immediately unless the user explicitly requests publish-now behavior in the current task.
- Upload or select media through Maeve before attaching it to content.
- Inspect integration capabilities before platform-specific settings, and inspect dynamic options when a capability field includes `optionKey`.
- Return created or changed IDs, workspace, integration, status, scheduled time, and the next review step after every mutation.

## Safety Rules

Require explicit confirmation immediately before any action that is externally visible, destructive, or broad:

- Publish, retry publishing, archive, restore, delete, or schedule content when intent is ambiguous.
- Send, resend, withdraw, resubmit, or request approvals or client reviews.
- Send inbox replies, moderate inbox messages, retry failed inbox messages, delete failed messages, or mark threads read in bulk.
- Delete content, media, failed inbox messages, grid planner items, folders, labels, or hashtag groups.
- Bulk-delete media, bulk-move media, bulk-label or bulk-unlabel media.
- Promote grid items to content, reorder large grids, or remove covers when the result is unclear.
- Generate or export analytics reports that may create files, notify users, or consume plan-limited resources.

If confirmation is missing, summarize the exact action, target IDs, workspace, integration, and expected external effect, then ask for confirmation before proceeding.

For MCP high-risk tools, pass the documented exact `confirmationText` only after the user confirms the current action and target. For CLI fallbacks, append `--yes` only after the same confirmation.

## References

Load only the reference needed for the current task:

- `references/command-reference.md` for CLI command groups and recommended sequences.
- `references/content-payloads.md` for JSON payload shapes, timezone handling, UUID fields, and examples.
- `references/integration-capabilities.md` for platform requirements, capability fields, media limits, and dynamic options.
- `references/mcp-tools.md` for hosted MCP setup, supported MCP tools, and CLI fallbacks.
- `references/safety-policy.md` for confirmation boundaries and credential handling.
- `references/troubleshooting.md` for auth, validation, integration, timezone, plan, rate-limit, and provider errors.
